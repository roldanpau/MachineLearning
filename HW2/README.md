# HW2

- Take a simple classification dataset (e.g. Iris) and implement LR either using raw Python/Numpy or TensorFlow or Keras (or multiple of them for extra points)

I took a not-so-simple classification dataset and implemented logistic
regression using simple Python. This is done in Colab file 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EIxfs98TbSH7gyu1z6MvG_tVWhfhXkHB

The dataset if more interesting than the Iris dataset in the sense that it is
not linearly separable. Thus the classification results are not as good.

Basically, I copy-pasted snippets of code from the Rashka book: Python ML. 

Some important ideas that stick after this exercise:

1) It's very important to normalize the features if they have wildly different
ranges. 

2) Python is very sensitive about tabs.
