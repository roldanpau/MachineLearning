I did not use this dataset, because it only consists of two classes (edible/poisonous).
I used the Iris dataset instead, with 3 classes (setosa, virginica, versicolor).

- One hot encode feature values

- If you have problems with the number of features, feel free to throw some away

For simplicity, I started with only 2 features (sepal length, width).

- Perform Logistic Regression on this dataset using Keras.

I used softmax, NOT One-v-All.

I tried using Keras but it was too hard to understand. I fell back to using plain Python instead.
Basically, I copy-pasted snippets of code from the Rashka book: Python ML.
